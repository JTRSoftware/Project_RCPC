#TECHNICAL PROPOSAL: RCPC PROJECT (Original name [PT]: Rede Comunitária de Processamento e Conhecimento)

Title: Community-Based Knowledge Processing Network
Vision: Democratization of AI infrastructure through volunteer computing and intellectual merit.

1. Conceptual Foundation
Inspired by successful models such as Folding@home, the RCPC Project proposes that processing power and logical intelligence should not be restricted to large data centers. The network uses idle resources from home devices to create a living library of knowledge and execution.

2. Local Agent (Terminal) Architecture
The user maintains full control over their hardware through a simplified interface:

Resource Management: Strict definition of CPU percentage, selection of specific cores, and limits for RAM and GPU.
Shared Folder: Access to an isolated directory where the user deposits code snippets and the network deposits usage statistics.

Intelligent Translation: Use of AI to interpret logic submitted in any language (e.g., Pascal) and translate it into the optimized language of the final destination.

3. Logic Economy and Incentives
The system transforms contributions into tangible value:

Micro-rewards: Generation of credits (e.g., Google Play, Steam, or direct funds) based on the volume of "collections" and validations of each node.

Configurable Altruism: Option to redistribute rewards to community funds for users who choose not to receive them.

Attribution of Authorship: Mandatory inclusion of metadata comments in each distributed code block, guaranteeing permanent credit to the original author.

4. Evolution and Recognition (MasterDev)
The project culminates in the identification of talent through pure technical meritocracy:

Impact Statistics: A global ranking based on the efficiency and real usefulness of the submitted code. MasterDev Events: Global competitions to highlight the best "logic architects," regardless of their formal academic background, focusing solely on the ability to solve complex problems with elegance and low resource consumption.
