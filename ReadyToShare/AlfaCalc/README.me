# AlfaCalc

**AlfaCalc** is a high-performance, arbitrary-precision calculator designed for engineers, programmers, and enthusiasts who need to perform complex calculations across multiple numerical bases (Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Alfadecimal/Base-36).

Developed by **JTR Software**, AlfaCalc follows the philosophy: *"It is simple to look complicated, the complicated part is looking simple."*

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Base Synchronized Display**: View your calculations simultaneously in Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Alfadecimal (Base-36).
- **Infinity Display System**: A robust UI that supports scrolling and copying numbers of virtually unlimited length without visual glitches.
- **Arbitrary Precision Engine**: Perform calculations on numbers of extreme magnitude, limited only by your hardware.
- **Swap Memory Support**: Unique disk-based arithmetic for operations that exceed the available RAM.
- **High-Precision Benchmarking**: Real-time calculation timing (milliseconds/seconds) for every operation.
- **Turbo Mode (Auto-Convert Toggle)**: Optimize performance when dealing with millions of digits by disabling real-time base conversion.
- **Safety Locks**: Intelligent state management that prevents invalid operations, such as changing bases mid-calculation or accidental multiple decimal separators.
- **Full Keyboard Support**: Hotkeys enabled for all operations, base switching, and numeric input.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Lazarus / FreePascal**: High-efficiency Object Pascal core.
- **Custom Math Units**: 
  - `sMath.pas`: Arbitrary precision decimal logic.
  - `sHexMath.pas`: Base-16 logic.
  - `sAlfaMath.pas`: Base-36 logic.
  - `sSwapMath.pas`: Disk-based overflow handling.

## 📦 Installation

This project is built using **Lazarus**. 

1. Clone the repository.
