# sMath units - "Saiyan DNA" Math Engine 🧬🔥

Stimulating minds through simple, stable, and powerful code.

## 🥋 Philosophy
> "It is simple to look complicated, the hard part is to look simple."
> -- *JTR Software*

This project demonstrates how fundamental algorithms (DNA), when well-structured, can overcome hardware and language limitations. We use string-based and disk-based arithmetic to allow calculations that exceed the native capabilities of 16, 32, or 64-bit processors.

## 🌌 Transformations (Versions)

### 1. Super-Saiyan (`sMath`) - RAM Power
Fast calculations in RAM, ideal for numbers with up to a few million digits.
- **Pascal (Delphi, Lazarus, Turbo Pascal)**
- **C#**
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **Java**

### 2. Super-Saiyan + Kaiōken (`sSwapMath`) - Disk Power
Massive calculations using the disk (Swap) as an infinite extension of the ALU. Allows processing numbers with Terabytes of digits.
- **Pascal (Delphi, Lazarus, Turbo Pascal)**
- **C#**
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **Java**

## 🚀 How to Contribute
This project is part of the **RCPC** initiative. Feel free to create new branches from `ReadyToShare` and add new "languages" (programming languages) or optimize existing ones to reach **Ultra Instinct (Migatte no Gokui)**.
